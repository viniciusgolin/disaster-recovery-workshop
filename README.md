## Disaster Recovery on AWS

Languages: [PT](README.pt.md)

The focus of this content is the reliability patterns and how to apply them to your solutions using AWS services. 
This material is based on the [Reliability Pillar](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS-Reliability-Pillar.pdf?ref=reliability-refarch) of the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/?ref=reliability-refarch). 
It provides a set of mechanisms to help customers to apply best practices in the design, delivery, and maintenance of Amazon Web Services (AWS) environments. 
By adopting the architectural approaches in this content you will build solutions that have resilient components and proven recovery processes.

This content is intended for those in technology roles, such as Chief Technology Officers (CTOs), solutions architects, developers, and operations team members. 
After reading this, you will understand AWS best practices and strategies to use when designing cloud architectures for reliability.
